One of my key projects was building a custom dashboard for internal use, which streamlined data visualization and reporting for the company. I worked on integrating third-party APIs, ensuring seamless data flow between services, and troubleshooting issues that arose during development. My daily activities included writing clean, maintainable code, participating in code reviews, and adhering to best practices in software engineering. I also assisted in refactoring legacy code to improve scalability and maintainability, which involved updating outdated libraries and restructuring database schemas. This experience deepened my understanding of MVC architecture and RESTful API design. Additionally, I collaborated with UI/UX designers to translate wireframes into functional interfaces, ensuring cross-browser compatibility and mobile responsiveness. Throughout the internship, I gained valuable insights into agile development methodologies, participating in sprint planning and daily stand-ups. I learned to manage tasks using project management tools and communicated effectively with team members to resolve technical challenges. My exposure to real-world development environments enhanced my problem-solving skills and adaptability. Overall, my time at Nusantara Techno provided me with hands-on experience in full-stack web development, strengthened my technical foundation, and prepared me for future roles in the software industry.'
