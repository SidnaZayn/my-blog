### Hi buds !
this write i dedicated to my self for embracing my self to write. thanks me for braving to start to write in this 'ungrammatical' English. lol.

### My Tech Story
for the first blog, i will start with my tech background story. <br><br>
i was graduated from a boarding school that there's nothing in it. i'm not sure what i'm going to do with my life since i was 8th grade. after thinking a lot, i decided to try Landscape Architecture Major. but, unfortunately, i failed. <br><br>
thankfully i was set my deciding some plan if i was failed in 'A' plan. <br>
the next plan is trying on State Accounting Collage for Taxing Diploma. but again, i failed. <br>

### The contemplating Moment
there's some moment that i think i was'nt born lucky. so many things that i'm unlucky. i was very deep for the fact that i dont have any intelligence. i was killing time for sleep and play, hopefully that kind of activity can distract me.

### Accidental Moment
after someday of contemplating, my mother suddenly got moved to other town that made her only came back twice in a week. so famlily decide to make me study in the city, and maintain the home. in this small city, there's no many university and major. only Informatics Engineering is in my list. so i decide to study there.

### Accidental Luck
i dont know how it goes, but fortunately this major is my capability. i can do well in this major. moreover, i can do better than my friend in class, i was so lucky. hahahaha

### Conclusion
thank you for reading. still dont know what wisdom that you can take xixixixi.
